Good evening.

My name is Wes, and as an avid video game player, it's my dream to one day
be a developer for either an independant team or work in the Triple-A
portion of the industry (preferably with a company that doesn't treat
employees and/or customers like trash (LOOKIN' AT YOU, ELECTRONIC ARTS)).
